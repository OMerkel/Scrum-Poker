Abstract
--------

<p>In agile process environments a popular iterative and incremental approach for
  agile development and management of product development is <strong>SCRUM</strong>.
  One iterative aspect in <em>SCRUM</em> is the <em>Sprint</em> with its defined
  fixed cycle duration. Planning of <em>Sprint</em> cycles is performed by the
  <em>Team Members</em> in each cycle. While agreeing on scope and content of
  working <em>Tasks</em> derived from <em>Epics</em> and <em>Stories</em> in
  a <em>Sprint Backlog</em> the <em>Team</em> is in charge to come up with valid
  complexity and time estimates per <em>Task</em>.</p>
<p>This application provides a tool supporting a <em>Team</em> to find estimates for these
  <em>Tasks</em>. It can be used as a replacement for physical <em>SCRUM Planning Poker</em>
  card sets.</p>
  
In Short
--------

<p>At the beginning of your <em>SCRUM Planning Poker</em> find an agreement on the
  <strong>Card Deck Type</strong> to be used in your Poker session and select the
  corresponding valid card faces.</p>
<p>Swiping left from Main screen allows to select your desired card value.</p>
<p>Back on Main screen you can toggle the displayed card to show front face or the
  back face so that the card can be kept hidden with your hardware device screen
  facing up.</p>
<p><strong>Mug</strong> selection shows a coffee mug indicating that a team member likes
  to go for a break. All other values indicate your personal estimate for the
  <em>Task's Complexity</em>. Enjoy...</p>
